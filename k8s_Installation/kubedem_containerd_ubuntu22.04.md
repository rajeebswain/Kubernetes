## Kubernetes Cluster Setup with Kubeadm and Containerd on AWS Ubuntu
#### Kubernetes Cluster Setup:
---
1.	To run containers in Pods, Kubernetes uses a container runtime.
2.	Kubernetes works with all container runtimes that implement a standard known as the container runtime interface (CRI). This is essentially a standard way to communicate between Kubernetes and the container runtime, and any runtime that supports this standard automatically works with Kubernetes. 
3.	Docker does not implement CRI, so Kubernetes implemented Docker shim, an additional layer to serve as an interface between Kubernetes and Docker. Now, however, there are plenty of runtimes available that implement the CRI, and it no longer makes sense for Kubernetes to maintain special support for Docker. 
4.	Mirantis and Docker have agreed to partner to maintain shim code standalone outside Kubernetes, as a conformant CRI interface for the Docker Engine API. They call it cri-dockered.
5.	Docker is not actually a container runtime! It’s actually a collection of tools that sits on top of a container runtime called containerd. 
6.	If you use Docker, it means you already use containerd as runtime. So in a production environment no need for Docker, as we only need the runtime, i.e. containerd lightweight runtimes. 
7.	So we can deploy directly containerd in a production environment.
---
 

Before we deploy the Docker, Kubelet uses to talk with CRI to deploy containers. As Docker doesn’t support CRI, we are using Docker shim which use to be supported and provided by Kubernetes. 

Now Kubernetes doesn’t provide docker shim as the container runtime which is provided by containerd can use directly as it supports the CRI. Now kubelet talks directly with the CRI for deploys containers.

### Cluster Setup on AWS using Kubeadm:
In Kubeadm the control plane component like API server, scheduler, and ETCD will run as a POD, so we should have containerd or container runtime supported by Kubernetes. 

Prerequisites:
1.	A compatible Linux host. The Kubernetes project provides generic instructions for Linux distributions based on Debian and Red Hat, and those distributions without a package manager.
2.	2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps).
3.	2 CPUs or more.
4.	Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
5.	Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node.
6.	Certain ports are open on your machines.
7.	Swap disabled. You MUST disable swap in order for the kubelet to work properly.
8.	For example, sudo swapoff -a will disable swapping temporarily. To make this change persistent across reboots, make sure swap is disabled in config files like /etc/fstab, systemd.swap, depending how it was configured on your system.

[Kubeadm link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/) Iinstallation guide for Kubeadm.

1. Open the ports for communication. 
[ports-and-protocol](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/) 

On Master Node: Open the below ports in the security group
```
6443/tcp        for Kubernetes API Server
2379-2380       for etcd server client API
6783/tcp,6784/  udp for Weavenet CNI
10248-10260     for Kubelet API, Kube-scheduler, Kube-controller-manager, Read-Only Kubelet API, Kubelet health
80,8080,443     Generic Ports
30000-32767 for NodePort Services
```
On Slave Node: Open the below ports in the security group
```
6783/tcp,6784/  udp for Weavenet CNI
10248-10260 for Kubelet API etc
30000-32767 for NodePort Services
```

2.	Now add the unique name for the nodes as master, slave1, and slave2. You can add any name. The purpose is only to add identification.
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname slave1
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname slave2
```
Or
```
Sudo hostname master
Exec bash
```
3.	Run on all nodes of the cluster as a root user.
```
sudo su
```
4.	Disable SWAP
```
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i -e '/swap/d' /etc/fstab
```
5.	Install containerd:
   -	Installing Containerd from the bofficial binaries: [containerd-official-repo](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md)
     
   Download the binaries of containerd
 	
```
sudo wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v1.7.3/containerd-1.7.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz 
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local containerd-1.7.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
   -	Install Control Groups:

In Kubernetes, a "system" generally refers to the collection of components and processes that work together to manage and maintain the overall health and operation of the Kubernetes cluster itself.
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/main/containerd.service 
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/
sudo mv containerd.service  /usr/local/lib/systemd/system/containerd.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
```
   -	Install runc:
```
sudo wget https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.1.8/runc.amd64 
sudo install -m 755 runc.amd64 /usr/local/sbin/run
```
   -	Install CNI:
```
sudo wget https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.3.0/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.3.0.tgz 
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
sudo tar Cxzvf /opt/cni/bin cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.3.0.tgz
```
When we install docker, the docker CLI and docker daemon come in a package, so docker use to install both CLI and daemon. But here we need to install separately a CLI which can interact with containerd.

Install CRICTL as CLI to interact with containerd. Now CIRCTL will interact with the UNIX socket of containerd, as like docker cli interact with docker UNIX socket.[CLI-Details-Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) 

   -	Install CRICTL:
```
VERSION="v1.26.0" # check latest version in /releases page
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases/download/$VERSION/crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar zxvf crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
sudo rm -f crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz
``` 
CRICTL is a universal tool to interact with containerd, not specific for containerd. So after installation, we need to attach the CRICTL with the UNIX socket of the containerd. Else CRICTL won’t interact with containerd. 

How to add CRICTL with the UNIX socket of containerd is available in the document of CRI. [CRICTL-Configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/blob/master/docs/crictl.md) 

---
#### CRICTL by default connects on Unix to:
- unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock or
- unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock or
- unix:///run/crio/crio.sock or
- unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock
---
Now create a file name as /etc/crictl.yaml, and add the UNIX socket ad save the file.
```
vi /etc/crictl.yaml
runtime-endpoint: unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
image-endpoint: unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
timeout: 2
debug: false  
pull-image-on-create: false
```
Or
```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/crictl.yaml
 runtime-endpoint: unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
image-endpoint: unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock
timeout: 2
debug: false
pull-image-on-create: false
EOF
```
Make debug=false, else it will generate a lot of debug file. 

## Here the containerd installation completed. 
---

Here enable Network Forwarding. [Port-Forwarding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)           
            
- Forwarding IPv4 and letting iptables see bridged traffic 
   
      cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
      overlay
      br_netfilter
      EOF

      sudo modprobe overlay
      sudo modprobe br_netfilter

      # sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
      cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
      net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
      net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
      net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
      EOF

      # Apply sysctl params without reboot
      sudo sysctl –-system
      sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables net.ipv4.ip_forward
      modprobe br_netfilter
      sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
6.	Install Kubectl, kubelet and kubeadm
```
apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```
8.	Run the below commands on the master Node Only:
```
sudo kubeadm config images pull
sudo kubeadm init
```
- This will pull the kubeadm component such as apiserver, etcd, etc. 
- Kubeadm init will initialize the cluster. 
- If more than one master node is available then use the network flag with kubeadm init, because when kubeadm initializes it tries to find out the network cidr, so if more than one master node is available, it will conflict and generate an error.
- So it is mandatory to specify during initialization which cidr kubedadm will consider. 
```
e.g., sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
```
- The pod network CIDR you set during kubeadm init must match the CIDR range supported by the chosen CNI plugin. If the CIDR ranges are not compatible, the networking might not work as expected.
9. To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user: (Only On Master)
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```
10. Install the CNI (Container Network Interface) on master Node Only:
```
sudo kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml 
```
CNI plugins are crucial components in Kubernetes that provide the networking infrastructure necessary for pods and containers to communicate with each other and the outside world. They ensure proper network connectivity, isolation, and security, enabling the smooth functioning of distributed applications within a Kubernetes cluster.
Once the installation is completed, generate the joining token from the master node and execute the token in slave nodes. 
```
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

- When we have only one network internally, the Kubernetes control plane automatically initializes to the available network.
- In order to start using cluster basically cluster creates a config file.
- In Kubernetes for the communication between Kubectl or any external resources with the API of Kubernetes there is no UNIX socket like Docker. The API server listening on some IP addresses and 6443 port.
- The tools which want to communicate, need proper configuration for it to communicate.
- Cluster generates the config file, which Kubectl tries to find the files in the three standard locations, and then it will merge the files.
- Kubectl talk with this config file, the config file has the IP address and port number of the API server.
- Kubectl read that information and it will talk with the API.
- The Kubernetes cluster by default generates the config file `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`.
- But the Kubectl will try to read the config file from `$HOME/.kube/config`. So after the Kubernetes cluster is initialized successfully, copy the configuration file to the `$HOME/.kube/config` location.
- Now Kubectl will read that config file and talk with the API server.
 ```
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
$ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
$ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```
